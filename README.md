## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to create the box shadow around the card and how to use the hover and active css properties

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css

a:hover{
    color: var(--Yellow);
}

.container{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    border: .5px solid black;
    border-radius: 16px;
    max-width:400px;
    gap: 1rem;
    padding: 2rem;
    background-color: var(--White);
    box-shadow: 10px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,1);
}
