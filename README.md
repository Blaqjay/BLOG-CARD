## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to create the box shadow around the card and how to use the hover and active css properties

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css

a:hover{
    color: var(--Yellow);
}

.container{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    border: .5px solid black;
    border-radius: 16px;
    max-width:400px;
    gap: 1rem;
    padding: 2rem;
    background-color: var(--White);
    box-shadow: 10px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,1);
}


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
